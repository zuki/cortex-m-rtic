# Tips & tricks

## Generics

Resources may appear in contexts as resource proxies or as unique references
(`&mut-`) depending on the priority of the task. Because the same resource may
appear as *different* types in different contexts one cannot refactor a common
operation that uses resources into a plain function; however, such refactor is
possible using *generics*.

All resource proxies implement the `rtic::Mutex` trait. On the other hand,
unique references (`&mut-`) do *not* implement this trait (due to limitations in
the trait system) but one can wrap these references in the [`rtic::Exclusive`]
newtype which does implement the `Mutex` trait. With the help of this newtype
one can write a generic function that operates on generic resources and call it
from different tasks to perform some operation on the same set of resources.
Here's one such example:

[`rtic::Exclusive`]: ../../../api/rtic/struct.Exclusive.html

``` rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/generics.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --example generics
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/generics.run}}```

Using generics also lets you change the static priorities of tasks during
development without having to rewrite a bunch code every time.

## Conditional compilation

You can use conditional compilation (`#[cfg]`) on resources (the fields of
`struct Resources`) and tasks (the `fn` items). The effect of using `#[cfg]`
attributes is that the resource / task will *not* be available through the
corresponding `Context` `struct` if the condition doesn't hold.

The example below logs a message whenever the `foo` task is spawned, but only if
the program has been compiled using the `dev` profile.

``` rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/cfg.rs}}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --example cfg --release

$ cargo run --example cfg
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/cfg.run}}```

## Running tasks from RAM

The main goal of moving the specification of RTIC applications to attributes in
RTIC v0.4.0 was to allow inter-operation with other attributes. For example, the
`link_section` attribute can be applied to tasks to place them in RAM; this can
improve performance in some cases.

> **IMPORTANT**: In general, the `link_section`, `export_name` and `no_mangle`
> attributes are very powerful but also easy to misuse. Incorrectly using any of
> these attributes can cause undefined behavior; you should always prefer to use
> safe, higher level attributes around them like `cortex-m-rt`'s `interrupt` and
> `exception` attributes.

> safe abstraction for it in `cortex-m-rt` v0.6.5 but there's an [RFC] for
> adding a `ramfunc` attribute in a future release.

[RFC]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/100

The example below shows how to place the higher priority task, `bar`, in RAM.

``` rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/ramfunc.rs}}
```

Running this program produces the expected output.

``` console
$ cargo run --example ramfunc
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/ramfunc.run}}```

One can look at the output of `cargo-nm` to confirm that `bar` ended in RAM
(`0x2000_0000`), whereas `foo` ended in Flash (`0x0000_0000`).

``` console
$ cargo nm --example ramfunc --release | grep ' foo::'
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/ramfunc.grep.foo}}
```

``` console
$ cargo nm --example ramfunc --release | grep ' bar::'
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/ramfunc.grep.bar}}
```

## Indirection for faster message passing

Message passing always involves copying the payload from the sender into a
static variable and then from the static variable into the receiver. Thus
sending a large buffer, like a `[u8; 128]`, as a message involves two expensive
`memcpy`s. To minimize the message passing overhead one can use indirection:
instead of sending the buffer by value, one can send an owning pointer into the
buffer.

One can use a global allocator to achieve indirection (`alloc::Box`,
`alloc::Rc`, etc.), which requires using the nightly channel as of Rust v1.37.0,
or one can use a statically allocated memory pool like [`heapless::Pool`].

[`heapless::Pool`]: https://docs.rs/heapless/0.5.0/heapless/pool/index.html

Here's an example where `heapless::Pool` is used to "box" buffers of 128 bytes.

``` rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/pool.rs}}
```
``` console
$ cargo run --example pool
{{#include ../../../../ci/expected/pool.run}}```

## Inspecting the expanded code

`#[rtic::app]` is a procedural macro that produces support code. If for some
reason you need to inspect the code generated by this macro you have two
options:

You can inspect the file `rtic-expansion.rs` inside the `target` directory. This
file contains the expansion of the `#[rtic::app]` item (not your whole program!)
of the *last built* (via `cargo build` or `cargo check`) RTIC application. The
expanded code is not pretty printed by default so you'll want to run `rustfmt`
over it before you read it.

``` console
$ cargo build --example foo

$ rustfmt target/rtic-expansion.rs

$ tail target/rtic-expansion.rs
```

``` rust
#[doc = r" Implementation details"]
const APP: () = {
    #[doc = r" Always include the device crate which contains the vector table"]
    use lm3s6965 as _;
    #[no_mangle]
    unsafe extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
        rtic::export::interrupt::disable();
        let mut core: rtic::export::Peripherals = core::mem::transmute(());
        core.SCB.scr.modify(|r| r | 1 << 1);
        rtic::export::interrupt::enable();
        loop {
            rtic::export::wfi()
        }
    }
};
```

Or, you can use the [`cargo-expand`] sub-command. This sub-command will expand
*all* the macros, including the `#[rtic::app]` attribute, and modules in your
crate and print the output to the console.

[`cargo-expand`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-expand

``` console
$ # produces the same output as before
$ cargo expand --example smallest | tail
```

## Resource de-structure-ing

When having a task taking multiple resources it can help in readability to split
up the resource struct. Here are two examples on how this can be done:

``` rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/destructure.rs}}
```
