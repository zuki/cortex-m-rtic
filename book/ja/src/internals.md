# Under the hood

This section describes the internals of the RTIC framework at a *high level*.
Low level details like the parsing and code generation done by the procedural
macro (`#[app]`) will not be explained here. The focus will be the analysis of
the user specification and the data structures used by the runtime.

We highly suggest that you read the embedonomicon section on [concurrency]
before you dive into this material.
